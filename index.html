        <div class="subheading mb-5">Liberal Studies: Elementary Teaching</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Welcome! My name is Aylea Gonzalez, and I’m currently a second-year student at UC Riverside, where I recently made an exciting switch to major in Liberal Studies. Driven by a love for learning and a deep commitment to making an impact, I strive to bring both heart and determination to everything I do. Through my academic journey and personal projects, I’m learning more about how to connect people, ideas, and creativity to shape meaningful experiences.

I consider myself to be a compassionate and collaborative leader, shaped by years of involvement in student government during high school. Serving in various roles for all four years, I took on leadership positions that taught me the value of listening, adapting, and encouraging others to bring their strengths to the table. Those experiences inspired my passion for teamwork and community engagement, and they taught me that great leaders don’t just direct—they uplift. Whether organizing events, managing teams, or brainstorming ways to engage my peers, I found that every project was a chance to learn, grow, and create something memorable.

Alongside my leadership experiences, I’m also passionate about the creative fields. I have a background in marketing and graphic design, skills I’ve used to lead branding projects, promote events, and express ideas visually. Art and design allow me to explore my creative side while thinking critically about how to communicate messages that resonate. The intersection of art, communication, and impact has become a driving force in my work, and I’m constantly seeking new ways to blend these elements in both academic and personal projects.

Outside of school and work, I’m someone who thrives on connection and adventure. I love to travel, whether it's exploring new cities or discovering hidden gems close to home. My family and friends are incredibly important to me, and I find balance and inspiration in spending time with them. Life’s best memories are often made through these shared experiences, and I believe they keep me grounded, balanced, and motivated to take on new challenges.

As I look toward my future, I’m excited to continue growing in my field, embracing opportunities that push me to think bigger and give back to others. Liberal Studies offers a path that feels both broad and specific, allowing me to dive into topics that intrigue me and explore ways to make a meaningful difference. I’m open to wherever this journey leads, whether it’s a role in elementary education, community organizing, or a creative field that lets me merge my passions. 

Thank you for visiting my page and taking the time to get to know a little bit about me. I’m always open to connecting with others who share similar interests or have unique perspectives. Let’s make a difference together!<br><br>
